Socio-Economic Country Profiles Using PCA and K-Means Clustering
Project Overview
This project analyzes socio-economic data from various countries to uncover meaningful patterns and group countries into clusters based on their socio-economic profiles. This project provides insights into how countries compare across key socioeconomic indicators by leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means clustering for grouping.

Objectives
Dimensionality Reduction: Use PCA to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while retaining the most critical information.
Clustering: Apply K-Means clustering to group countries based on their socio-economic attributes.
Insights: Visualize and interpret the clusters to identify trends and similarities among countries.
Features
Dimensionality reduction with PCA to simplify analysis and visualization.
Clustering using K-Means to group countries into distinct socio-economic categories.
For better understanding, visualise PCA components, elbow method, and country clusters.
Insights into socio-economic disparities, similarities, and global trends.

Dataset
Source: [[Provide source, e.g., World Bank, United Nations, or Kaggle Dataset].](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nishanthsalian/socio-economic-country-profile-basic-analysis/input)
Description: Includes socio-economic indicators like GDP per capita, literacy rate, life expectancy, unemployment rate, and more.
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables if needed.
